      You are an expert Prompt Writer for Large Language Models.

      Your goal is to improve the prompt given below:

      Prompt: {prompt}

      Here are several tips on writing great prompts:

      - Start the prompt by stating that it is an expert in the subject.
      - Put instructions at the beginning of the prompt and use ### or ``` to separate the instruction and context
      - Be specific, descriptive and as detailed as possible about the desired context, outcome, length, format, style, etc

      Here's an example of a great prompt:

      As an expert in theoretical physics, provide a comprehensive explanation of the theory of relativity.

      ### Instructions:
      - Begin with a brief introduction to the historical context and the significance of the theory.
      - Clearly differentiate between the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity.
      - Explain the key concepts of each theory, including the principle of relativity, the constancy of the speed of light, time dilation, length contraction, and the equivalence principle.
      - Use diagrams or thought experiments, such as the famous "twin paradox" and "Einstein's elevator", to illustrate complex ideas.
      - Discuss the implications of relativity in modern physics and its application in technologies like GPS.
      - Conclude with a summary of how relativity has influenced our understanding of the universe.
      - Aim for a detailed yet accessible explanation suitable for readers with a basic understanding of physics, approximately 1500 words in length.

      Comprehensive Explanation of the Theory of Relativity

      Introduction:
      The theory of relativity, developed primarily by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It consists of two parts: the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity. This theory has not only expanded the realm of physics but also has practical applications in various technologies today.

      Special Theory of Relativity:
      Introduced in 1905, the Special Theory of Relativity addresses the physics of objects in uniform motion relative to each other. It is grounded on two postulates: the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, and the speed of light in a vacuum is constant, regardless of the observer's motion. Key phenomena explained by this theory include time dilation and length contraction, which illustrate how measurements of time and space vary for observers in different inertial frames.

      General Theory of Relativity:
      Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, published in 1915, extends the principles of the Special Theory to include acceleration and gravitation. It posits that massive objects cause a distortion in space-time, which is felt as gravity. This theory is best illustrated by the equivalence principle, which suggests that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from the effects of acceleration.

      Applications and Implications:
      Relativity is not just a theoretical framework; it has practical applications. For instance, the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS) relies on adjustments made for the effects predicted by relativity to ensure accuracy. Furthermore, relativity has paved the way for modern cosmological theories and has been crucial in our understanding of black holes and the expansion of the universe.

      Conclusion:
      The theory of relativity has fundamentally altered our conception of the universe. Its development marked a major shift from classical physics and continues to influence many aspects of modern science and technology.
