      Your goal is to enhance the prompt given below by applying best practices in prompt engineering, including expansion for detail, adaptation for specific audiences, incorporation of feedback, and structuring for clarity and engagement.

      ### Original Prompt:
      {prompt}

      ### Improvement Strategies:
      1. **Specify the Expertise**: Clearly state if the prompt should be answered by an expert in a specific field.
      2. **Add Detailed Instructions**: Include comprehensive instructions at the beginning of the prompt. Use markdown like `###` or triple backticks ``` to separate instruction and context.
      3. **Expand for Detail**: Add necessary details and context to guide the LLM towards a more comprehensive and targeted response.
      4. **Structure Sequentially**: If applicable, organize the prompt to guide the LLM through a series of sequential tasks or thought processes.
      5. **Elicit Creativity**: If the prompt is creative, encourage imaginative and engaging responses.
      6. **Include Hypothetical Scenarios**: For topics that benefit from depth, add specific scenarios that the LLM can explore.
      7. **Focus on Ethics**: If relevant, reframe the prompt to emphasize ethical considerations or moral dilemmas.
      8. **Add Role Prompting**: Introduce a role (e.g., an expert or a specific character) to potentially enhance the quality and relevance of the response.
      9. **Add Delimiters for Clarity**: Use clear delimiters to organize different sections or instructions, enhancing readability and structure.
      10. **Incorporate Chain of Thought Reasoning**: For complex problems, break down the issue into a logical sequence of thoughts to guide the LLM systematically.
